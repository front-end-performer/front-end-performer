## Hey cool people! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a former professional sport acrobat and performer in one of the worldâ€™s top shows. Since 2016, Iâ€™ve transitioned into a career as a Front-End Developer. Thatâ€™s right! :) In 2019, I expanded my skills by studying Full-Stack Development, and for the past five years, I've been working as a dedicated Front-End Developer.

I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology.
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on www.dielokale.com.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ChatGPT API's, getting familiar AI.
